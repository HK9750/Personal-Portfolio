          <p className="text-base text-grey leading-7">
            Hello! Iâ€™m Hasnain Khan, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a
            love for creating seamless and efficient web applications. With
            extensive experience in React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript, I
            specialize in building robust front-end solutions while ensuring
            smooth backend integrations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-grey leading-7">
            I have a strong foundation in software engineering principles, which
            allows me to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Whether
            working solo on a project or collaborating with a team, I am
            committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet user
            requirements and exceed expectations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-grey leading-7">
            Outside of work, you can find me experimenting with new
            technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or diving into
            the world of problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode.
